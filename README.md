This is a fork of the [hoverboard-firmware-hack-FOC](https://github.com/EFeru/hoverboard-firmware-hack-FOC) project that adds AB encoder support and brake resistor functionality for precision motor control applications.

### Key Improvements Over Original Repository

1. **Smooth Torque Output at Zero RPM**

Encoder feedback enables true zero-speed torque control with no cogging or vibration. Perfect for FFB devices like direct drive wheel base, ffb joystick, seatbelts.

2. **PSU Support**

Integrated brake resistor support allows safe operation from bench power supplies. The brake resistor dissipates regenerative energy that would otherwise cause voltage spikes and damage PSUs or trip overvoltage protection.

3. **High-Quality Input Control Performance**

Enhanced PWM input processing (both hardware and software implementations) provides:
- low latency 1000hz polling
- Noise-free
- High Resolution

For information on all improvments see [Pull Request #3](https://github.com/SiMachines/hoverboard-firmware-hack-FOC/pull/3#issue-3584417632).

## My Use Case: Direct Drive FFB Wheelbase, FFB Joystick, Seatbelt Tensioner, Rudder Pedals
Wheelbase and Joystick project [Arduino-FFB-wheel](https://github.com/ranenbg/Arduino-FFB-wheel)  by Miloš Ranković

Wheelbase compatible project [OpenFFB](https://github.com/Ultrawipf/OpenFFBoard)  by Yannick Richter 

Any usb controller capable of outputting PWM and Reading ab encoder signals will work, in this case I am using Rane's firmware with arduino pro micro.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Select Your Variant

In `platformio.ini`, uncomment your desired configuration:

```ini
default_envs = ONE_AXIS_VARIANT    ; Single motor with encoder
;default_envs = TWO_AXIS_VARIANT   ; Dual motors with encoders
```

### 2. Essential Configuration

Edit `Inc/config.h` with your specific parameters:

#### Battery Configuration
```c
#define BAT_CELLS               10      // Your battery cell count:
                                        // 6s  = 24V (22.2V - 25.2V)
                                        // 10s = 36V (37V - 42V)
                                        // 13s = 48V (48.1V - 54.6V)
```
### Encoder Configuration

```c
#define ENCODER_X
#define ENCODER_X_PPR              2048     // Your encoder pulses per revolution
#define ALIGNMENT_X_POWER          6553     // Sensor alignment voltage out of 16000 for HW & SW-PWM, out of 1000 for the others
```
#### Internal Brake Resistor 
Uses the left motor driver as a brake resistor (left motor must be disabled).

```c
#define INTBRK_L_EN                         // Enable internal brake on left driver
```
